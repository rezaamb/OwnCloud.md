How to install ownCloud on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy

# 1. Update Ubuntu 22.04

First, update your system to its latest state by running the below-given command:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

#2. Install Apache

To install OwnCloud on an Ubuntu 22.04 server, we need an Apache web server, PHP, and MySQL stack on our system.

```bash
sudo apt install apache2
```
To make sure the webserver service is enabled in the background.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now apache2
```
To check status:

```bash
systemctl status apache2 --no-page -l
```
3. Install PHP and required extensions 

The PHP version available to install using the default standard repository of Ubuntu 22.04 is 8.x. However, while writing this article, OwnCloud doesn’t support PHP 8.0. Hence, we are installing PHP7.4 using the Ondrej PPA repo.

To have the required version of PHP, add the Ondrej repository:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
```
Run system update command:

```bash
sudo apt update
```
Install required extensions:

```bash
sudo apt install php7.4 php7.4-{opcache,gd,curl,mysqlnd,intl,json,ldap,mbstring,mysqlnd,xml,zip}
```
 
4. Secure MySQL installation

Next, secure your MySQL database server by creating a new root password and removing the demo database, users, and limited remote access.

Login to MySQL

```bash
sudo mysql
```

You can change the root user password for MySQL to whatever you want. However, remember to replace Mypassword@123 in the given command with the password you want to set.
```bash
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password by 'MyPassword@123';
```
```bash
exit;
```
Run command to secure MySQL installation:
```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
The script will ask these questions.
```
Enter the password for user root: type your set password and then press ENTER.
Change the password for root? Press N, then ENTER.
Remove anonymous users? Press Y, then ENTER.
Disallow root login remotely? Press Y, then ENTER.
Remove test database and access to it? Press Y, then ENTER.
Reload privilege tables now? Press Y, then ENTER.
```
 
5. Create a Database for OwnCloud

To store the data generated by OwnCloud, we need a database server, and we use MySQL. So, let’s create a Database for OwnCloud using the given commands:

Login to MySQL DB server
```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```
Note: Use the password you created while securing MySQL to log in.

Follow the command to create a new DB. However, don’t forget to replace the new_user with whatever name you want to give to your Database user, and in the same way- new_db with a name for the Database and your_password for the password.
```bash
CREATE DATABASE new_db;

CREATE USER 'new_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON new_db.* TO 'new_user'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Exit;
```
 
6. Download ownCloud on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Although OwnCloud is open-source software, not available to install using the default package manager. Therefore, we need to download the latest version of the ownCloud file manually. Go to your terminal and run the given commands.
```bash
cd /tmp
```
```bash
wget https://download.owncloud.com/server/stable/owncloud-complete-latest.tar.bz2
```
Now extract the downloaded file:
```bash
sudo apt install bzip2
```
```bash
tar -xvf owncloud-complete-latest.tar.bz2
```
Move the extracted folder to the web root directory. 
```bash
sudo mv owncloud /var/www/html/
```
Change the ownership of the ownCloud directory:
```bash
sudo chown -R www-data: /var/www/html/owncloud
```
 
7. Configure ownCloud Apache configuration

To efficiently serve Owncloud files, let’s configure the virtual host configuration file on the Apache web server.
```bash
sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/owncloud.conf
```
Copy-paste the following lines:
```bash
<VirtualHost \*:80>

ServerAdmin admin@example.com
DocumentRoot /var/www/html/owncloud
ServerName example.com

<Directory /var/www/html/owncloud>
Options FollowSymlinks
AllowOverride All
Require all granted
</Directory>

ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/example.com_error.log
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/your-domain.com_access.log combined

</VirtualHost>
```
Save the file using Ctlr+O, hit the Enter key, and exit the text editor using Ctlr+X.

 
8. Install OwnCloud on Ubuntu 22.04

Finally, after following the steps above, open your system’s browser and point it to the server IP address or domain address where you have installed the OwnCloud.

Example:
```
http://server-ip/owncloud
or 
http://domain.com/owncloud
```
 
9. Create an Admin account

As we get the Owncloud web interface, the first thing we have to do is create an Admin account.

After that, scroll down and add the details of the Database you created for OwnCloud, then click on “Finish Setup.”

Wait for a few seconds, and you will see the Login interface. Use the Admin account details you created to access the Dashboard.
